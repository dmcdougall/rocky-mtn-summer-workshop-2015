        <p>The University of Colorado Denver is hosting a summer workshop on uncertainty quantification from July 15-17, 2015. This intensive three-day workshop will provide hands-on training on the mathematical theory behind and application of state-of-the-art open source software and computational tools for the quantification of uncertainty and a posteriori error estimation in physics-based models.</p>
        <p>Participants will have an unique opportunity to personally interact with several of the leading researchers in this emerging area of computational mathematics and predictive science. Approximately half of each day is devoted to the practical application of the theory and participants will leave this workshop with many computational examples and software that may serve as a template for future research projects.</p>
<h3>Registration Information</h3>        
        <p>This workshop is aimed primarily at graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, but all applications for registration will be considered. Space is limited and support for travel will only be provided for graduate students and/or postdoctoral researchers on an as-needed basis. All decisions on registration and support will be made final within two weeks of the deadline for travel support on April 3, 2015. If your travel will be supported by other means, please indicate this on your cover letter in order to reserve your spot prior to the deadline.
        <p>We anticipate providing full travel support for up to 20 participants. To apply for full or partial travel support and/or to reserve your spot for this workshop send a cover letter explaining your interest in the workshop, your CV, and a letter of recommendation to <a href="mailto: rmswuq@gmail.com">rmswuq@gmail.com</a>. The deadline for consideration of travel support is April 3, 2015.</p>
