    <h1>Rocky Mountain Summer Workshop on Uncertainty Quantification</h1>
    <h2>University of Colorado Denver</h2>
    <h3>July 15-17, 2015</h3>
    <p>The University of Colorado Denver is hosting a summer workshop on uncertainty quantification from July 15-17, 2015. This intensive three-day workshop will provide hands-on training on the mathematical theory behind and application of state-of-the-art open source software and computational tools for the quantification of uncertainty and a posteriori error estimation in physics-based models.</p>
    <p>Participants will have an unique opportunity to personally interact with several of the leading researchers in this emerging area of computational mathematics and predictive science. Approximately half of each day is devoted to the practical application of the theory and participants will leave this workshop with many computational examples and software that may serve as a template for future research projects.</p>
